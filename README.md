# CCTV-Motion-Detection-
We all want to keep our property safe and have installed CCTV. Why not secure it more using python. I have built a simple python code that can access you DVR and enable a motion detection algorithm using python. 


To use this Code simply download python and install the libraires 

Afterwards change the DVR IP and pascodes to your required data. 

Then give it a go

This is free to use
